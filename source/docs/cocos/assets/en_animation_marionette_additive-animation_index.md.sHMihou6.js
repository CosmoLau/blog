The underlying logic for using additive animation is that you can add the same type of changes to different animations, such as leaning forward, backward, left, or right when a character is moving differently. If you use additive animation, you can add the same effect to walking, running, jumping, standing, etc., instead of having to create a set of similar animations for each state, which reduces the amount of animation assets needed for each state.</p><h2 id="generating-additive-animations" tabindex="-1">Generating Additive Animations <a class="header-anchor" href="#generating-additive-animations" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Generating Additive Animations&quot;">​</a></h2><p>Currently, additive animations can only be generated from animation clips.</p><p>By checking the &quot;Import as Additive&quot; box in the Animation Import Configuration panel, the selected animation clip will generate an additive animation when it is used in an animation drawing:</p><p><img src="'+c+'" alt=""></p><blockquote><p>Note that an animation is either imported as an additive animation or as a non-additive animation.
