When developing the UI, we need to correctly set the each node&#39;s <code>size</code>, and which can be automatically stretched and adapted according to the screen size of the device. To achieve this, we usually use 9-sliced format images to render these nodes. In this way, even if small original images can be used to generate background images that can cover the entire screen. On the one hand, the game package is reduced, and on the other hand, it can be flexibly adapted to different layout requirements.</p><p><img src="'+s+'" alt="compare"></p><p>The right side of the picture above displays the texture of original size.

First open the <strong>Sprite Editor</strong>, select the image asset in <strong>Assets</strong>, then click the <strong>Edit</strong> button on the bottom of <strong>Inspector</strong>. If the height of your window is not large enough, you might need to scroll <strong>Inspector</strong> downward to see the button at the bottom.</p><p>After opening <strong>Sprite Editor</strong>, you will see there is a green line around the image, which indicates the position of the current 9-sliced split line. Drag the mouse to the split line, you will see the shape of the cursor change, then you can press down and drag the mouse to modify the position of the split line.</p><p>We click and drag the four split lines at the top, bottom, and sides respectively and cut the image into a 9-slicing. The nine areas will apply different zooming in/out strategies when the Sprite size changes, which is as illustrated below:</p><p><img src="'+n+'" alt="sliced"></p><p>And the following picture illustrates the state of zooming in/out in different areas (the picture comes from <a href="http://yannickloriot.com/2011/12/create-buttons-in-cocos2d-by-using-cccontrolbutton/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Yannick Loriot&#39;s Blog</a>):</p><p><img src="'+a+'" alt="scaling"></p><p>After cutting, don&#39;t forget to click the green check mark on the upper right corner of <strong>Sprite Editor</strong> to save modifications to the asset.</p><h2 id="set-the-sprite-component-to-use-sliced-mode" tabindex="-1">Set the Sprite component to use Sliced mode <a class="header-anchor" href="#set-the-sprite-component-to-use-sliced-mode" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Set the Sprite component to use Sliced mode&quot;">​</a></h2><p>After you have prepared the 9-sliced asset, you can modify the draw mode of the Sprite and modify the <code>size</code> to make a UI element that can specify any size.</p><ol><li>First, select the Sprite node in the <strong>Scene/Hierarchy</strong>, set the <code>Type</code> property of the Sprite as <code>Sliced</code> in the <strong>Inspector</strong>.</li><li>Then drag the control point with the <a href="./../../../editor/scene/">Rect Transform Tool</a> to enlarge the <code>size</code> property of the node.
