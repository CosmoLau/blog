Generally speaking, we realize the adaptation scheme for multi-resolution through the following technology:</p><ul><li><strong>Canvas</strong> component immediately obtains the actual resolution of the device screen and appropriately adjusts the size of all the render elements in the scene.</li><li><strong>Widget</strong> component add to UI nodes. It can align the element with different referential positions of the target node(e.g. the default is the parent node) according to different needs.</li><li><strong>Label</strong> component has a built-in function that provides various dynamic layout modes. When the bounding box of labels change because of the alignment requirement of the Widget, labels will present the perfect layout effect according to your needs.</li><li><strong>Sliced Sprite</strong> provides images whose size can be arbitrarily designated. Simultaneously, it can meet various alignment requirements and display images with high definition on screens of any resolution.</li></ul><p>Next, start off by getting to know the concepts of design resolution and screen resolution, then we will go on to learn the zooming in/out function of the <a href="./../editor/canvas">Canvas</a> component.</p><h2 id="design-resolution-and-screen-resolution" tabindex="-1">Design resolution and screen resolution <a class="header-anchor" href="#design-resolution-and-screen-resolution" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Design resolution and screen resolution&quot;">​</a></h2><p><strong>Design resolution</strong> is the resolution sample used by content creators when creating the scene. But <strong>screen resolution</strong> is the actual resolution of the device that the game is running on.</p><p>Normally, design resolution will use the screen resolution of the device that is being used the most by the targeted group on the market, such as: screen resolutions of <code>800x480</code> and <code>1280x720</code> that are being used by Android devices currently, or screen resolutions of <code>1136x640</code> and <code>960x640</code> that are being used by iOS devices. Therefore, after designers or directors set up the scene by using design resolution, the game will automatically adapt to the device used by the major targeted group.</p><p>Then when the design resolution is different from the screen resolution, how could <strong>Cocos Creator</strong> adapt to the device?</p><p>Supposing the design resolution is <code>800x480</code>, designers will create a background image of the same resolution.</p><p><img src="'+i+'" alt="design resolution"></p><h3 id="when-design-resolution-and-screen-resolution-have-the-same-aspect-ratio" tabindex="-1">When design resolution and screen resolution have the same aspect ratio <a class="header-anchor" href="#when-design-resolution-and-screen-resolution-have-the-same-aspect-ratio" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;When design resolution and screen resolution have the same aspect ratio&quot;">​</a></h3><p>When design resolution and screen resolution have the same aspect ratio, supposing the screen resolution is <code>1600x960</code>, enlarging the background image to 1600/800 = <strong>2 times</strong> will perfectly fit the screen. This is the simplest situation, which will not be discussed in detail here.</p><h3 id="when-the-aspect-ratio-of-design-resolution-is-more-than-that-of-screen-resolution-the-height-should-be-adjusted-to-avoid-black-borders" tabindex="-1">When the aspect ratio of design resolution is more than that of screen resolution, the height should be adjusted to avoid black borders <a class="header-anchor" href="#when-the-aspect-ratio-of-design-resolution-is-more-than-that-of-screen-resolution-the-height-should-be-adjusted-to-avoid-black-borders" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;When the aspect ratio of design resolution is more than that of screen resolution, the height should be adjusted to avoid black borders&quot;">​</a></h3><p>Supposing the screen resolution is <code>1024x768</code>, a red frame is used in the following picture to indicate the visible area of the device screen. We use <code>Fit Height</code> mode provided by the Canvas component to make the height of the design resolution automatically cover the height of the screen, i.e., enlarging the scene image to 768/480 = <strong>1.6 times</strong>.</p><p><img src="'+n+'" alt="fit height"></p><p>This is a fairly good adaptation mode when the aspect ratio of the design resolution is more than that of the screen resolution. As illustrated above, although some parts of the background image will be cut down on the two sides of the screen, it can be ensured that no goof or black borders will appear in the visible area of the screen. Then the position of UI elements can be adjusted by the Widget, which makes sure that the UI elements will appear in the visible area of the screen. We will introduce this in detail in the next section, the <a href="./widget-align">Widget Align</a> documentation.</p><h3 id="when-the-aspect-ratio-of-the-design-resolution-is-less-than-that-of-screen-resolution-the-width-should-be-adjusted-to-avoid-black-borders" tabindex="-1">When the aspect ratio of the design resolution is less than that of screen resolution, the width should be adjusted to avoid black borders <a class="header-anchor" href="#when-the-aspect-ratio-of-the-design-resolution-is-less-than-that-of-screen-resolution-the-width-should-be-adjusted-to-avoid-black-borders" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;When the aspect ratio of the design resolution is less than that of screen resolution, the width should be adjusted to avoid black borders&quot;">​</a></h3><p>Supposing the screen resolution is <code>1920x960</code>, a red frame is also used in the following picture to indicate the visible area of the device screen. We use <code>Fit Width</code> mode provided by the Canvas component to make the width of the design resolution automatically cover the width of the screen, i.e., enlarging the scene to 1920/800 = <strong>2.4 times</strong></p><p><img src="'+a+'" alt="fit width"></p><p>When the aspect ratio of the design resolution is relatively small, the use of this mode will cut down some parts of the background image on the upper/lower sides of the screen.</p><h3 id="no-matter-how-much-the-aspect-ratio-of-the-screen-is-all-the-contents-of-design-resolution-will-be-completely-displayed-and-black-borders-are-permitted" tabindex="-1">No matter how much the aspect ratio of the screen is, all the contents of design resolution will be completely displayed, and black borders are permitted <a class="header-anchor" href="#no-matter-how-much-the-aspect-ratio-of-the-screen-is-all-the-contents-of-design-resolution-will-be-completely-displayed-and-black-borders-are-permitted" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;No matter how much the aspect ratio of the screen is, all the contents of design resolution will be completely displayed, and black borders are permitted&quot;">​</a></h3><p>In the last example, supposing the screen has a resolution of <code>640 x 960</code>. If you want to make sure the background image is completely displayed on the screen, you need to simultaneously open <strong>Fit Height</strong> and <strong>Fit Width</strong> in the Canvas component. The zooming in/out proportion of the scene image is calculated according to the smaller dimension in the screen resolution. In the example in the following picture, because the aspect ratio of the screen is less than 1, the zoom ratio will be calculated based on the width, that is, 640/800 = <strong>0.8 times</strong>.</p><p><img src="'+r+'" alt="show all"></p><p>Under such a displaying mode, there might be black borders on the screen or scene image that exceed the design resolution (goof). Although developers try their best to avoid black borders in general, if you want to make sure all the contents within the scale of design resolution are displayed on the screen, use this mode too.</p><h3 id="according-to-the-screen-aspect-ratio-fit-width-or-fit-height-will-be-automatically-selected" tabindex="-1">According to the screen aspect ratio, <code>Fit Width</code> or <code>Fit Height</code> will be automatically selected <a class="header-anchor" href="#according-to-the-screen-aspect-ratio-fit-width-or-fit-height-will-be-automatically-selected" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;According to the screen aspect ratio, `Fit Width` or `Fit Height` will be automatically selected&quot;">​</a></h3><p>If there is no strict requirement for the content that may be cropped down on the four sides of the screen, you can not enabled any adaptation mode in the Canvas component. At this time, <strong>Fit Width</strong> or <strong>Fix Height</strong> will be automatically selected according to the screen aspect ratio to avoid black border. In other words, when the aspect ratio of the design resolution is more than the screen resolution, <strong>Fit Height</strong> will be automatically opened (as in the first picture above); when the aspect ratio of the design resolution is less than the screen resolution, <strong>Fit Width</strong> will be automatically opened (as in the second picture above).</p><h3 id="design-resolution-can-only-be-configured-in-the-project-settings" tabindex="-1">Design resolution can only be configured in the project settings <a class="header-anchor" href="#design-resolution-can-only-be-configured-in-the-project-settings" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Design resolution can only be configured in the project settings&quot;">​</a></h3><p>The current design mode does not allow multi-resolution coexistence, so the design resolution of multiple Canvas in the project still uses the same set of design resolution and adaptation scheme, and you can configure it in <strong>Project -&gt; Project Setting -&gt; General -&gt; Default canvas setting</strong>.</p><p><img src="'+l+'" alt="resolution-config"></p>',29),d=[c];function u(g,p,m,f,b,w){return o(),t("div",null,d)}const _=e(h,[["render",u]]);export{v as __pageData,_ as default};
