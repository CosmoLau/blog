In addition to standard moving, rotation, scaling and frame animations, it also supports arbitrary component properties and user-defined property drivers, plus arbitrary time curves and innovative trajectory editing, allowing content producers to create detailed dynamic effects without writing a single line of code.</p><p><img src="'+i+'" alt="animation cover"></p><blockquote><p><strong>Note</strong>: the <strong>Animation</strong> panel that comes with Cocos Creator is suitable for creating less complex animations that need to be linked with logic, such as UI animations. If you want to create complex effects, character animations, nested animations, etc., consider using Spine, DragonBones or skeletal animation editor for 3D models instead.</p></blockquote><h2 id="content" tabindex="-1">Content <a class="header-anchor" href="#content" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Content&quot;">​</a></h2><ul><li><p><a href="./animation-clip">Animation Clip</a>: asset containing animation data, reusable.
