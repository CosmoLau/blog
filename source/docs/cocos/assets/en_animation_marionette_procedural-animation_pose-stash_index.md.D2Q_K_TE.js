A <strong>pose stash</strong> (hereafter referred to as a pose stash or stash) is a means of implementing such a mechanism, which associates a pose graph.</p><blockquote><p>A visual, but incomplete, understanding of a pose stash is to think of a pose stash as a cache variable that holds pose objects.</p></blockquote><p>Pose stash is attributed to animation graph hierarchies. Multiple stashes can be created at each layer, and once created, the stash can be referenced in any pose graph in that layer via the <strong>Use Stash Pose</strong> node.</p><blockquote><p>We can think of this as taking some already edited pose node and saving it as some sort of blueprint or resource for use elsewhere. It&#39;s just that this blueprint has a limited scope and can only be in a specific layer in this animation graph. This also means that we can treat stash as some special pose node and use it just like a normal pose node.</p></blockquote><p>Pose stash is allowed to be referenced multiple times, and the associated pose graph will only be updated and evaluated once per frame.</p><h2 id="editing-a-pose-stash" tabindex="-1">Editing a pose stash <a class="header-anchor" href="#editing-a-pose-stash" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Editing a pose stash&quot;">​</a></h2><p>The <strong>Property Inspector</strong> of a selected animation graph layer allows you to view, create, and edit all pose stash for that layer.</p><p>Click on a layer in the animation graph and find the <strong>Layer Stashes</strong> property in the <strong>Property Inspector</strong>.</p><p><img src="'+o+'" alt="Alt text"></p><p>Click the <img src="'+n+'" alt="edit.png"> button to start editing the pose graph associated with the selected stash.
