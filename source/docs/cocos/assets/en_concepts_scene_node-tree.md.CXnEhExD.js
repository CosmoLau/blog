The hierarchical relationships between nodes need to be checked and manipulated using the <strong>Hierarchy</strong> panel.

Usually all nodes are not laid flat on the scene, but rather, organized into a node tree according to a certain classification and order (e.g.: according to our own preferences). Example:</p><p><img src="'+t+'" alt="node-tree"></p><p>The nodes displayed in the upper level are referred to as parent nodes and those displayed in the lower level are referred to as children. In the <strong>Hierarchy</strong> panel, the node tree in the above figure would look like this:</p><p><img src="'+s+'" alt="in_hierarchy"></p><p>In Cocos Creator 3.0, UI nodes require any parent node to have at least one <strong>UITransform</strong> component, if it does not comply with the rules, a Canvas node will be automatically added as its parent, the node tree in the above figure puts all UI nodes under the Canvas node. Next, parent nodes are created according to the category and put nodes of the same category under one parent node to build the node tree.</p><p>In real game projects, other methods (such as game logic) can be used to organize the node tree as needed.</p><h2 id="rendering-order-of-nodes" tabindex="-1">Rendering Order of Nodes <a class="header-anchor" href="#rendering-order-of-nodes" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Rendering Order of Nodes&quot;">​</a></h2><p>The rendering of 3D nodes is related to the Z-coordinate value of the distance between the node and the camera, transparency, etc.</p><p>The rendering and occlusion relationship of UI nodes, on the other hand, is influenced by the node tree, which is rendered in order of node arrangement from top to bottom in the <strong>Hierarchy</strong> panel, meaning that nodes displayed above the list are occluded by the nodes below them in the scene. Therefore, the child nodes will always cover the parent nodes.
