It&#39;s required.</p></li><li><p><strong>Desktop Icon</strong></p><p><strong>Desktop Icon</strong> is required. Click the <strong>search icon</strong> button at the back of the input box to select the icon you want. When building, the <strong>Desktop Icon</strong> will be built into the <strong>Huawei Quick Game</strong> project. It is suggested that the <strong>Desktop Icon</strong> is a <code>.png</code> image.</p></li><li><p><strong>Game Version Name</strong></p><p>This item is required. <strong>Game Version Name</strong> is the real version, such as: 1.0.0.</p></li><li><p><strong>Game Version Number</strong></p><p>This item is required. <strong>Game Version Number</strong> is different from the <strong>Game Version Name</strong>, and the <strong>Game Version Number</strong> is mainly used to distinguish the version update. Each time when you submit audit, the game version number is at least 1 higher than the value of the last submitted audit. It must not be equal to or less than the value of the last submitted audit, and it is recommended that the <strong>Game Version Number</strong> be recursively incremented by 1 each time when the audit is submitted</p><blockquote><p><strong>Note</strong>: the <strong>Game Version Number</strong> must be a positive integer.</p></blockquote></li><li><p><strong>Supported Minimum Platform Version Number</strong></p><p>This item is required.

The in-package volume of the mini-game contains code and assets that cannot exceed 10M, and assets can be loaded via network requests. <strong>Small Packet Mode</strong> is to help developers keep the script files in the mini game package, other assets are uploaded to the remote server, and downloaded from the remote server as needed. Cocos Creator has already helped the developer with the download, cache, and version management of remote assets. The developer needs to do is the following steps:</p><ol><li><p>When building, check the <strong>Small Packet Mode</strong> and fill in the <strong>Small Packet Mode Server Path</strong>.</p></li><li><p><strong>First game asset package into the game package</strong>, this item is optional.</p><p>In the Small Packet Mode, due to too many assets on the launch scene, downloading and loading assets for a long time may result in a short black screen when entering the game for the first time. If <strong>First game asset package into the game package</strong> is checked, you can reduce the black screen time when you first enter the game. However, it should be noted that the <code>res/import</code> asset does not support split asset downloading at this time, and the entire <code>import</code> directory is also packaged into the first package.</p><p>Developers can choose whether to check this item according to their needs. Then click on <strong>Build</strong>.</p></li><li><p>After the build is complete, click the <strong>Open</strong> button after the <strong>Build Path</strong> to upload the <code>res</code> directory under the release path to the small packet mode server. For example, if the default release path is <code>build</code>, the <strong>Build Task Name</strong> is <code>huawei-quick-game</code>, you need to upload the <code>/build/huawei-quick-game/res</code> directory.</p></li></ol><p>At this point, the <code>res</code> directory will no longer be included in the built-up <strong>rpk</strong>, and the assets in the <code>res</code> directory will be downloaded from the filled <strong>Small Packet Mode Server Path</strong> through the network request.</p></li><li><p><strong>Keystore</strong></p><p>When you check the <strong>Keystore</strong>, the default is to build the <strong>rpk</strong> package with a certificate that comes with Creator. This certificate is used only for <strong>debugging</strong>.</p><blockquote><p><strong>Note</strong>: when the <strong>rpk</strong> package is to be used to submit an audit, do not check the <strong>Keystore</strong> to build it.</p></blockquote><p>If you don&#39;t check the <strong>Keystore</strong>, you need to configure the signature files <strong>certificate.pem path</strong> and <strong>private.pem path</strong>, where you build a <strong>rpk</strong> package that you can <strong>publish directly</strong>.
