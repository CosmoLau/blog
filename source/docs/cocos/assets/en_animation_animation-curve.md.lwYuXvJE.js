An animation curve is actually a linear track made up of individual keyframes connected on the current property track, with each keyframe being a control point on this curve path. Under the curve editing view, the change of keyframe values is more visually noticed, and keyframe value changes can be adjusted more delicately.</p><p>Click the switch view button <img src="'+e+'" alt="curve btn"> on the side of the properties list to switch to the curve editing view. After switching to the curve editing view, you can see that the line markers will be displayed on the property list, and the line markers will not be displayed on the property tracks that do not support curve editing, and the curves will not be displayed normally when the corresponding property track is selected. When the corresponding curve is displayed in the curve editing area, the line marker will show the corresponding curve color, and the name of the currently selected curve will be displayed in the property menu area.</p><p><img src="'+n+'" alt="show-line"></p><h2 id="getting-to-know-the-curve-editor" tabindex="-1">Getting to know the curve editor <a class="header-anchor" href="#getting-to-know-the-curve-editor" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Getting to know the curve editor&quot;">​</a></h2><p>The <strong>Animation</strong> panel has a built-in curve editor for animation curves, which is actually the same as the particle curve editor.

After applying the preset, the interpMode of the keyframes at both ends of the curve clip will be adjusted to curve mode by default, and the weightMode of the keyframes will be modified to a state where the left and right sides of the curve clip can be stretched freely to achieve the same effect as the curve preset.</p><p><img src="'+s+'" alt="animation-curve-preset"></p>',12),l=[h];function d(u,p,m,v,f,g){return r(),i("div",null,l)}const k=t(c,[["render",d]]);export{y as __pageData,k as default};
