Please review the <a href="./example">External Module Usage Case</a> documentation for details.</p></li></ul><p>Cocos Creator natively supports and recommends the use of the ECMAScript (ESM for short) module format. To support the use of external modules, Cocos Creator also supports the CommonJS module format to some extent. For additional information about the module format and usage in Cocos Creator, please refer to the <a href="./spec">Module Specification</a> documentation.</p><p>Cocos Creator 3.3 experimentally supports import maps.
