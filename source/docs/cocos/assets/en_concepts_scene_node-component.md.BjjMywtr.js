Let&#39;s see how to create nodes and add components to a scene.</p><h2 id="nodes" tabindex="-1">Nodes <a class="header-anchor" href="#nodes" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Nodes&quot;">​</a></h2><p>Nodes are the basic building blocks of a scene. Nodes are organized in a tree-like relationship, and each node can have multiple children:</p><p><img src="'+a+'" alt="nodes"></p><p>Nodes have the following properties:</p><ul><li>A node contains a set of base attributes (Position, Rotation, Scale), and nodes are organized together by a set of relative transformation relationships, as described in <a href="./coord">coordinate systems and node transformation properties</a>.</li><li>The update order between nodes is cascading. The update of child nodes depends on the parent node, and child nodes follow the parent node transformations.</li><li>Components can be added to a node to associate multiple components with the node.</li></ul><h3 id="create-nodes" tabindex="-1">Create Nodes <a class="header-anchor" href="#create-nodes" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Create Nodes&quot;">​</a></h3><p>The quickest way to get a node with a specific function is to use the <strong>Create Node</strong> button in the top left corner of the <strong>Hierarchy</strong> panel. Take the simplest example of creating a Sphere node by clicking on the <strong>+</strong>, creating a Node button in the upper left corner and then selecting <strong>Create 3D Object -&gt; Create Sphere</strong>.</p><p><img src="'+s+'" alt="create"></p><p>Notice the newly added Sphere node in the <strong>Scene</strong> and <strong>Hierarchy</strong> panel. The new node is named <code>Sphere</code> by default, indicating that it is a node whose functionality is primarily provided by the <strong>Sphere</strong> component. Try clicking the <strong>Create Node</strong> button again to select another node type and see that they will be named and behave differently. Also, note that creating a UI node automatically creates a Canvas node as the root node of the UI node, as described in the document <a href="./../../2d-object/ui-system/">UI Structure Description</a>.</p><p>For more information about the operations of single-select, multi-select, copy, delete, etc. of nodes in the <strong>Hierarchy</strong> panel, please refer to the <a href="./../../editor/hierarchy/">Hierarchy Panel</a> documentation.</p><p>To create nodes dynamically in a script, refer to the <a href="./../../scripting/create-destroy">Create and Destroy Nodes</a> documentation.</p><h2 id="node-properties" tabindex="-1">Node Properties <a class="header-anchor" href="#node-properties" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Node Properties&quot;">​</a></h2><p><img src="'+r+'" alt="property"></p><ul><li><p><strong>Mobility</strong>：Mobility of nodes.

This is covered in detail in the <a href="./coord">Coordinate Systems and Node Transformation Properties</a> documentation.</p><p>Starting with the <code>cc.MeshRenderer</code> title is the property of the MeshRenderer component mounted on the Sphere. In Cocos Creator, the <strong>MeshRenderer</strong> component is used to render static 3D models, where the <code>Mesh</code> property is used to specify the mesh resources used for rendering. As the Sphere node was just created the default is <code>sphere.mesh</code>.</p><p>The <code>Materials</code> property is used to specify the <a href="./../../asset/material">material</a> used for rendering. You can try dragging any material from the <strong>Assets</strong> into the <code>Materials</code> property of the <strong>Inspector</strong> panel and you can see that the default material just became the specified material.</p><blockquote><p><strong>Note</strong>: any resources set on the component, such as <code>sphere.mesh</code> in this case, will be loaded automatically at the same time as the scene loads. Types of resources that need to be set and automatically loaded can also be declared in custom components, refer to the <a href="./../../scripting/load-assets">Getting and loading resources</a> documentation.</p></blockquote><p>In addition to adding components manually in the editor, they can also be added via scripts, for more details see the <a href="./../../scripting/component">Component creation and destruction</a> documentation.</p><h3 id="effect-of-node-properties-on-components" tabindex="-1">Effect of Node Properties on Components <a class="header-anchor" href="#effect-of-node-properties-on-components" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Effect of Node Properties on Components&quot;">​</a></h3><p>Once the node and <strong>MeshRenderer</strong> component are combined, the rendering of the mesh resources can be controlled by modifying the node properties. The node can also be adjust according to the properties marked by the red line in the figure below, notice that the rotation and scaling of the model have changed.</p><p><strong>Before adjustment</strong>:</p><p><img src="'+c+'" alt="node property"></p><p><strong>After adjustment</strong>:</p><p><img src="'+p+'" alt="node property"></p><p>As previously mentioned, component-based structure is combined to achieve functional extensions.

When the <code>Layer</code> property set in the node is included in the <a href="./../../editor/components/camera-component">Visibility property</a> of the camera, the node can be seen by the camera, and it supports mixed rendering of 3D and 2D components.
