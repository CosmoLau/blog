This allows the game world to behave in a more realistic manner. The physics engine is responsible for simulating the motion and collision feedback of objects in the game world based on their physical properties. It is worth noting that the physics system is a complex system that interacts with not only game logic, but also the rendering system, animation system, and audio system. Typically, the game physics system only covers the basics of Newtonian mechanics, such as collision detection and rigid body motion. Other physical phenomena, such as fluid dynamics or soft body physics, require alternative approaches. Users can use the API provided by the physics engine to manipulate the physics system and achieve various physical effects in the game.</p><p>Cocos Creator supports the following physics engines.</p><ul><li><strong>Bullet</strong>: default physics engine, asm.js/wasm version of <a href="https://pybullet.org/wordpress/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Bullet</a>.

Gives physics elements their physical properties. The physics system will perform physics calculations for these elements, such as calculating whether the objects collide and what forces are applied to the objects. When the calculations are complete, the physics system will update the physics world to the scene world, simulating the physical behavior that is restored in the real world.</p><p>Scene world and physics world:</p><p><img src="'+a+'" alt="Scene World vs. Physics World"></p><blockquote><p><strong>Note</strong>: The &quot;rigid body&quot; here refers to an object in the physics world that remains unchanged in shape and size and whose relative positions of internal points remain unchanged while in motion or after being acted upon by a force.</p></blockquote><h3 id="physics-work-flow" tabindex="-1">Physics Work Flow <a class="header-anchor" href="#physics-work-flow" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Physics Work Flow&quot;">​</a></h3><p>After all components are <code>lateUpdate</code>, the engine will synchronize the nodes holding physical properties (rigid body component, collider component) to the physics world and drive the physics engine to simulate them, and then synchronize the results calculated by the physics engine to each node of the scene after the simulation is completed.
