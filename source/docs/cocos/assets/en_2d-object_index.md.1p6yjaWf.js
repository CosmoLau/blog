Since the Canvas component inherits from the RenderRoot2D component, the Canvas component can also be the entry point for data collection. 2D rendering nodes must have a UITransform component as a requirement for rendering vertex data, click or alignment policies, etc.</p><p>2D rendering can also support rendering of models, the only condition is that nodes with model components (e.g. <code>MeshRenderer</code>/<code>SkinnedMeshRenderer</code>) must have <strong>UI/UIMeshRenderer</strong> components added to them in order to render on the same pipeline as the UI.</p><p>The 2D rendering flow is as follows:</p><p><img src="'+r+'" alt="render"></p><h2 id="_2d-object-classification" tabindex="-1">2D object classification <a class="header-anchor" href="#_2d-object-classification" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;2D object classification&quot;">​</a></h2><p>2D objects can be broadly classified into two categories, <strong>2D rendering objects</strong> and <strong>User-interface (UI)</strong>. The difference is that 2D rendering objects are generally only responsible for rendering 2D objects, while UI is more about user interaction.
