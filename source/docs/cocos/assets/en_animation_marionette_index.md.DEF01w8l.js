In general, the distinctions between the two include:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Legacy</strong>: Powered by the <strong>Animation</strong> component, the legacy system animates objects with animation states containing animation clips (which are keyframe animations created in Cocos Creator) and skeletal animations imported from external sources in the format of <code>.fbx</code>, <code>.gltf</code> and <code>.glb</code>.</p></li><li><p><strong>Marionette</strong>: Powered by the <strong>Animation Controller</strong> component, the Marionette system animate objects with pre-constructed animation graphs, which functions as a controller of multiple animation states that can only contain skeletal animations imported from external sources in the format of <code>.fbx</code>, <code>.gltf</code> and <code>.glb</code>.</p></li></ul><h2 id="content" tabindex="-1">Content <a class="header-anchor" href="#content" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Content&quot;">​</a></h2><p>The Marionette system consists of four modules:</p><ul><li><a href="./animation-graph">Animation Graph Assets</a></li><li><a href="./animation-controller">Animation Controller Reference</a></li><li><a href="./animation-graph-panel">Animation Graph Panel</a></li><li><a href="./animation-graph-layer">Animation Graph Layer</a></li><li><a href="./animation-graph-basics">Animation State Machine</a></li><li><a href="./state-transition">State Transition</a></li><li><a href="./animation-mask">Animation Mask</a></li><li><a href="./animation-variant">Animation Graph Variants</a></li><li><a href="./procedural-animation/">Procedural Animation</a></li></ul><h2 id="terminology" tabindex="-1">Terminology <a class="header-anchor" href="#terminology" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Terminology&quot;">​</a></h2><table><thead><tr><th style="text-align:left;">Function</th><th style="text-align:left;">Description</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td style="text-align:left;">Animation Graph Assets</td><td style="text-align:left;">Asset that contains the flow chart of animation states, Can be created in the <strong>Assets</strong> panel.

This is done in the Animation Graph panel once an Animation Graph asset is created. For more information, please see <a href="./animation-graph-panel">Animation Graph Panel</a>.</td></tr><tr><td style="text-align:left;">State</td><td style="text-align:left;">A state is an action that is usually portrayed by an animation clip, such as standby, walk, move, attack, etc. This should be distinguished from an <a href="./../animation-state">animation state</a> as used in the legacy system.</td></tr><tr><td style="text-align:left;">State Transition</td><td style="text-align:left;">An animated actor is likely to perform multiple actions, each portrayed by an animation clip and registered as an animation state. A <a href="./state-transition">state transition</a> contains the logical check for switching between different states. For instance, to create the death animation of a walking character, a state transition is needed to switch the walk state to the death state.</td></tr><tr><td style="text-align:left;">Animated State Machine</td><td style="text-align:left;">Collectively, all the animation states and the transitions between them can be constructed in a flow chart, which is known as an <a href="./animation-graph-basics">Animation State Machine</a>.</td></tr></tbody></table><p>A state machine as displayed in the Animation Graph panel is demonstrated in the screenshot below.
