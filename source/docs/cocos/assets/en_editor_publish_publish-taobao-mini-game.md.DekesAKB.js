For example: <code>$global.my = my;</code></p></li><li><p>Explanation of &#39;global-variables.js&#39;: The window variable is a reference to the global object, so it is necessary to ensure that variables on the global object already exist for temporary variables to have values. If you are using custom scripts or third-party plugins and encounter situations where global variables are missing, it is typically due to loading timing issues, where the script is used before it is fully loaded.</p></li><li><p>Taobao&#39;s Custom JavaScript Virtual Machine: Taobao utilizes its own custom JavaScript virtual machine, which is not developed based on V8. The number of draw calls has a more significant impact on frame rates compared to other platforms, so developers should make efforts to minimize the number of draw calls. To reduce draw calls, you can enable the texture atlas batch feature in the engine. In Creator project settings, enable &quot;CLEANUP_IMAGE_CACHE.&quot; Then, in the taobao-mini-game/src directory generated during the build, locate the settings.json file and change CLEANUP_IMAGE_CACHE to false.</p></li><li><p>Inconsistencies Among Taobao IDE, Simulator, and Real Device JS Environments: The JavaScript environments in Taobao&#39;s IDE, simulator, and real devices are not consistent. If there are no issues on real devices, it is recommended to report the problem directly to the Taobao platform.</p></li><li><p>Due to the additional performance overhead in real device debugging mode, it is advisable to use real device preview mode, rather than real device debugging mode, when verifying frame rates.</p></li></ul><h2 id="references" tabindex="-1">References <a class="header-anchor" href="#references" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;References&quot;">​</a></h2><ul><li><a href="https://open.taobao.com/v2/doc#/abilityToOpen?docType=1&amp;docId=121213&amp;treeId=804" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Taobao Document Center - CN</a></li></ul>',24),d=[l];function c(h,m,p,u,b,g){return o(),a("div",null,d)}const T=e(s,[["render",c]]);export{v as __pageData,T as default};
