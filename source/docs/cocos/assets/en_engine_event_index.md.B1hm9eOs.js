The event system can be used not only to send input actions (e.g. keyboard, mouse, touch) to the application in the form of events, but also to respond to things that happen during the game that require the attention of other objects in the form of events. For example, opening the checkout or reward screen after a game victory.</p><h2 id="use-of-events" tabindex="-1">Use of Events <a class="header-anchor" href="#use-of-events" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Use of Events&quot;">​</a></h2><p>Events need to be registered to get listened to.
