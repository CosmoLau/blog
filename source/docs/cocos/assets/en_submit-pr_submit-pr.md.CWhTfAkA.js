When you find areas where the engine, documentation, or examples can be improved during your game development process, simply suggesting it to the official team may not guarantee immediate follow-up due to limited resources. Therefore, we welcome all users to actively submit pull requests (PRs) to help make Cocos better. Found a bug in the engine? Submit a PR! Examples don&#39;t look appealing? Submit a PR! API comments unclear? Submit a PR! Typos in the documentation? Submit a PR! Want to contribute your valuable modifications to the game community? Submit a PR! The following repositories are currently the commonly used open-source repositories by the official team, and you can submit PRs to these repositories.</p><ul><li><strong>cocos/cocos-engine</strong>：<a href="https://github.com/cocos/cocos-engine/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">GitHub</a></li></ul><p>Now let&#39;s take a look at how to submit code to Cocos on GitHub, starting from scratch.</p><h2 id="register-a-github-account" tabindex="-1">Register a GitHub Account <a class="header-anchor" href="#register-a-github-account" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Register a GitHub Account&quot;">​</a></h2><p>Open the <a href="https://github.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">GitHub website</a> and register an account.
