Taking the default editor layout as an example, notice the names and roles of each panel:</p><p><img src="'+s+'" alt="main"></p><ul><li>(<strong>A</strong>) <a href="./hierarchy/">Hierarchy</a>: show all the nodes in the scene and their hierarchy in the form of a tree list, all the contents seen in the <strong>Scene</strong> panel can find the corresponding node entries in the <strong>Hierarchy</strong> panel, the contents of these two panels will be displayed simultaneously when editing the scene, and we usually use both panels to build scenes.</li><li>(<strong>B</strong>) <a href="./assets/">Assets</a>: shows all assets in the project assets folder (<code>assets</code>). Here the folders are displayed in a tree structure and automatically synchronized with changes made to the project asset folder contents in the operating system. Drag and drop files directly from outside the project, or import assets using the menu.</li><li>(<strong>C</strong>) <a href="./scene/">Scene</a>: workspace for displaying and editing the visual content of the scene. Building the scene in the <strong>Scene</strong> panel allows to get a WYSIWYG preview of the scene.</li><li>(<strong>D</strong>) <a href="./animation/">Animation</a>: used to edit and store animation data.</li><li>(<strong>E</strong>) <a href="./inspector/">Inspector</a>: used to view and edit the working area of the currently selected node and component properties. This panel displays the property data from the script definition in the most appropriate form and allows the user to edit them.</li><li>(<strong>F</strong>) <a href="./preview/">Preview</a>: after the scene is built, preview the game in action on the Web or native platform.</li></ul><p>Other important editor-based interfaces include:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Console</strong></p><p><img src="'+r+'" alt="console"></p><p>The <strong>Console</strong> displays error reports, warnings, or other editor- and engine-generated log messages. For details, please review the <a href="./console/">Console</a> documentation.</p></li><li><p><strong>Preferences</strong></p><p><img src="'+i+'" alt="Preferences"></p><p><strong>Preferences</strong> provides various editor-specific global settings, including global settings for native development environment, game preview, other extensions, etc. For details, please read the section <a href="./preferences/">Preferences</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>Project Settings</strong></p><p><img src="'+a+'" alt="Settings"></p><p><strong>Project Settings</strong> provides various project-specific personalization settings, including group management, feature cropping, project preview, custom engine, etc. For details, please review the <a href="./project/">Project Settings</a> documentation.</p></li><li><p><strong>Service</strong></p><p><img src="'+c+'" alt="service"></p><p>Cocos Service is a <strong>Service</strong> panel integrated within Cocos Creator.
